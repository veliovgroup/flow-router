# FlowRouter Extra

Carefully extended `flow-router` package. FlowRouter is a very simple router for [Meteor.js](https://docs.meteor.com/?utm_source=dr.dimitru&utm_medium=online&utm_campaign=Q2-2022-Ambassadors). It does routing for client-side apps and compatible with React, Vue, Svelte, and Blaze.

It exposes a great API for changing the URL and getting data from the URL. However, inside the router, it's not reactive. Most importantly, FlowRouter is designed with performance in mind and it focuses on what it does best: __routing__.

## Features:

- üì¶ Not dependent on Blaze, ready for [__React.js__](https://github.com/veliovgroup/flow-router/blob/master/docs/react.md) and other templating/components engines/libs;
- üì¶ No `underscore` package dependency;
- üë®‚Äçüíª TypeScript definition [`index.d.ts`](https://github.com/veliovgroup/flow-router/blob/master/index.d.ts)
- üë®‚Äçüî¨ Great [tests coverage](https://github.com/veliovgroup/flow-router/tree/master/test);
- ü•ë Up-to-date [dependencies](https://github.com/veliovgroup/flow-router/blob/master/package.js);
- üì¶ Support of [Fast Render](https://github.com/veliovgroup/flow-router/blob/master/docs/fast-render-integration.md) and [other great packages](https://github.com/veliovgroup/flow-router#related-packages);
- üìã Following semver with regular [releases](https://github.com/veliovgroup/flow-router/releases);
- üìã Great [wiki](https://github.com/veliovgroup/flow-router/wiki);
- üìã Great [quick start tutorial](https://github.com/veliovgroup/flow-router/blob/master/docs/quick-start.md).

## Install

```shell
meteor add ostrio:flow-router-extra

// { FlowRouter, Router, Route, Group, Triggers, BlazeRenderer, RouterHelpers }
```

### Usage

```js
import { FlowRouter } from 'meteor/ostrio:flow-router-extra';

// DISABLE QUERY STRING COMPATIBILITY
// WITH OLDER FlowRouter AND Meteor RELEASES
FlowRouter.decodeQueryParamsOnce = true;

FlowRouter.route('/', {
  name: 'index',
  action() {
    // Render a template using Blaze
    this.render('layoutName', 'index');

    // Can be used with BlazeLayout,
    // and ReactLayout for React-based apps
  },
  waitOn() {
    // Dynamically load JS per route
    return [import('/imports/client/index.js')];
  }
});

// Create 404 route (catch-all)
FlowRouter.route('*', {
  action() {
    // Show 404 error page using Blaze
    this.render('notFound');

    // Can be used with BlazeLayout,
    // and ReactLayout for React-based apps
  }
});
```

> [!TIP]
> If you're using TypeScript, FlowRouter supports it. For types to work you need to install and follow the instructions of [`zodern:meteor-types`](https://github.com/zodern/meteor-types#meteor-apps)

## Running Tests

1. Clone this package
2. In Terminal (*Console*) go to directory where package is cloned
3. Then run:

### Meteor/Tinytest

```shell
# Default
meteor test-packages ./

# With custom port
meteor test-packages ./ --port 8888

# With local MongoDB and custom port
MONGO_URL="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/flow-router-tests" meteor test-packages ./ --port 8888
```

### Running Typescript Test

1. Install [`tsd`](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/tsd) as a global package;
2. Run `tsd` in your terminal. `tsd` will find the correct `*.test.d.ts` file and return with any errors.
